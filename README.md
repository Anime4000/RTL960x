## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: SERIOUS RISKS WITH CUSTOM GPON SFP ONTs
When using custom **GPON SFP ONTs** (Small Form-factor Pluggable Optical Network Terminals), it‚Äôs important to be aware of potential risks and how they can affect not only your connection but also others on the same network.

Using custom GPON SFP ONTs can cause severe network issues, not just for you but for everyone on the same GPON port. A single faulty or misconfigured ONT can take down an entire GPON network, affecting dozens of users.

### üö® Major Risks
* **Network-wide Disruptions**<br><sup>A rogue ONT can cause signal collisions, disconnecting all users on the same fiber split.</sup>
* **ISP Blacklisting & Fines**<br><sup>ISPs may ban your service or impose penalties for unauthorized modifications.</sup>
* **Unstable Connection**<br><sup>Custom ONTs may fail to connect properly or frequently drop connections.</sup>

### ‚ö† **DANGER**
**A faulty SFP can take down an entire GPON network!**

# VEIP vs PPTP
| Code | Full name | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| PPTP | Physical Path Termination Point | Directly binds to a specific LAN port, with OLT managing VLANs and settings on the ONT. |
| VEIP | Virtual Ethernet Interface Point | Acts like a virtual interface (e.g., `tap0`), allowing ONT firmware to assign to LAN ports, router mode, management, or VoIP. |
> [!NOTE]
> Since a PON SFP Stick has only one interface to the host, its firmware may struggle to manage VLANs from both PPTP and VEIP. Many firmware versions simply bridge all VLANs from both, regardless of configuration, which can lead to issues:
> - If the same VLAN ID is used for different services on PPTP and VEIP, the stick‚Äôs firmware might bridge them together without distinction, potentially causing issues with DHCP/IPoE.
> - Most firmware prioritizes PPTP first, using VEIP only if PPTP is unavailable. A few firmware versions allow manual VLAN selection for bridging, independent of PPTP/VEIP.
> 
> Also, note that if your ISP uses **ME 148** (which enforces PPPoE and routing on the ONT), you may not be able to bridge directly to your own router. For bridge mode, it's best to contact your ISP for assistance.

# 4-Port LAN (UNI)
Many ISPs use PPTP to bind specific LAN ports to different service providers, allowing one ONT to support multiple ISPs. For instance, LAN 1 might be configured for ISP 1, LAN 2 for ISP 2, and so forth. This setup is common in areas served by single fiber vendors that host multiple ISPs.

However, this multi-ISP setup can pose issues for PON Sticks, as they might struggle to bridge VLANs on any port other than LAN 1. This limitation occurs because PPTP configurations, along with the Forwarding Operation (FwdOp), are often designed specifically for ONTs and may not be fully recognized by PON sticks. Some advanced setups attempt to resolve this by using an HGU MIB file to "trick" the OLT (Optical Line Terminal) into accepting the ME 84 and ME 171 operations, allowing better compatibility.

# Fake O5 State
Some OLTs from manufacturers like Calix and Nokia, which support Universal ONU, may provide a ‚Äúfalse O5‚Äù state, which can be misleading. A device might reach the O5 state (the operational stage where data transmission typically begins) even with incorrect Serial Number or PLOAM Password. In this scenario, the OLT might allow the connection to reach O5 but won‚Äôt actually push any VLAN configurations (typically ME 84 & ME 171).

To resolve this, double-check all configuration parameters, including the serial number and password. If the connection still doesn‚Äôt work after verification, the OLT may be requiring Vendor-Specific Managed Entities (ME) (IDs 350-399) which are sometimes mandated by ISPs for authentication or additional configuration.

# O2-O5 Loop
A device entering an O2-O5 loop (oscillating between states) could indicate a similar issue as the "Fake O5" scenario. Another common reason for this loop is low optical receive power (RX), where the power level drops below the acceptable threshold (e.g., `<= -23 dBm`). When this happens, the OLT may refuse to allow a stable O5 state to maintain PON performance.

To address an O2-O5 loop caused by low RX power:

* Inspect and clean the fiber connector to ensure there‚Äôs no dirt or damage impacting signal strength.
* Check RX readings after cleaning, as improved optical power might stabilize the connection and help maintain a steady O5 state.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è
> [!CAUTION]
> If you have attempted all troubleshooting steps and are still unable to establish a connection, it‚Äôs recommended to stop further adjustments. Persistent errors or invalid configurations will be flagged by your ISP, and further experimentation can unintentionally disrupt the entire PON network in your area, affecting other users.

# Repository Scope and Legal Considerations
Please note that this repository does not contain ISP-specific configurations or sensitive information, both for legal reasons and to ensure responsible use. We aim to provide general guidance without supporting any unauthorized activity.

If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable GPON Stick solution that is ready to use with minimal setup, consider checking with resellers in your country. Many resellers offer modified PON Sticks pre-configured for local ISPs, including:

* **Pre-configured serial numbers (S/N) and PLOAM passwords:**<br><sup>Some resellers can program these credentials before shipping, making installation seamless and avoiding configuration hassle.</sup>
* **Enhanced compatibility:**<br><sup>In many cases, these units are plug-and-play, tailored for compatibility with specific ISPs.</sup>

> [!NOTE]
> By choosing a pre-configured unit from a reputable source, you can save time and ensure stability without needing to adjust settings manually.
